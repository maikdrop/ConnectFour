  Abstract:
  The class is the model of the game "Connect Four". It encapsults the game logic in order
  to set a disc in a column of the game field. Furthermore it detects if 4 discs are in a row
  horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If so, a notfication about the game end is send to
  all who are interested in. The same message is sent when all fields have been set in the game field.
